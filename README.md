# Question Classification with Keras

**Abstract:**
Using Keras to create a very simple question classification model. The model is able to classify three types of questions: number/amount, location, color and object.

e.g.

'what is a dog' -> object

'how many dogs are there' -> number

'where is the dog' -> location

'what is the dog's color' -> color

**Data:**
