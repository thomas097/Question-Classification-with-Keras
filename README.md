# Question Classification with Keras

**Abstract:**
Using Keras to create a very simple question classification single layer perceptron model. The model is able to classify three types of questions: number/amount, location, color and object.

| Question | Answer Type |
| --- | --- |
| what is a dog | object |
| how many dogs are there | number |
| where is the dog | location |
| what is the color | color |

**Results:**
Due to the simplicity and size of the dataset it is possible to obtain very accurate (98%+) results with a simple model.

**Data:**
The dataset that has been used can be found at:
